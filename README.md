## Introduction

For Aave, one of the main current and future goals is growth of liquidity and
user base. As seen on side-chains with low transaction cost like Polygon or
Avalanche, there is high demand to use the Aave protocol with small amounts to
earn high yield. That's why we brought to you an initial phase of the Aave <>
Starknet integration allowing deposit/withdrawal on Aave Ethereum by
exclusively transacting on Starknet.

The bridge allows users to deposit and withdraw their [aTokens](https://docs.aave.com/developers/tokens/atoken), and only `aTokens`, on StarkNet and get
`static_a_tokens` - wrappers converting balance-increasing `aTokens` into
exchange-rate-increasing `static_a_tokens`. We assume that L1 tokens approved by the bridge are pre-validated tokens, and that they are not deflationary.

The bridge is also shaped for liquidity providers who are able to assume the
Ethereum gas cost of deposits and withdrawals as they transact large enough
amounts. They will deposit on Aave Ethereum, bridge the `static_a_tokens` to
Starknet and make them available for users there to buy and hold, accruing this
way yield from L1.

## Contracts

### Overview

`L1`

- `Bridge` - handles rewards update, deposit & withdrawal of
  `static_a_tokens`, their corresponding `aTokens` and their underlying
  assets
- `Proxy` - A proxy implementation

`L2`

- `static_a_token` - exchange-rate-increasing wrapper of `aTokens` on
  Starknet
- `incentivized_erc20` - tracks users' claimable rewards and current reward index for
  each `static_a_token`
- `rewAAVE` - ERC20 representing the rewards on L2
- `bridge` - bridge responsible for:
  - minting and burning `static_a_tokens` on message from L1
  - bridging `rewAAVE` tokens back to L1
  - updating `rewards_index` for each `static_a_token` on message from L1
- `proxy` - generic implementation of a proxy in cairo

### More about static_a_token on L2

Natively, Aave tokens grow in balance, not in value. To be able to create this
kind of model, it is important to wrap them before bridging, converting them in
a token that grows in value, not in balance.

`static_a_tokens` are an implementation of the wrapped `aTokens` that will
continuously increase in value on Starknet because they are backed by the
increasing `aTokens` amounts locked in the bridge contract on Ethereum.
`static_a_tokens` can then be bridged back to `aTokens`.

### Proxies

All calls made to the following contracts will be handled by a proxy who
delegates the calls to the available implementation of these contracts.

- `bridge` on L2
- `static_a_token`s on L2
- `Bridge` on L1
- `rewAAVE` token on L2

### Governance

- `static_a_token`s are controlled by L2 `bridge`.
- `rewAAVE` token is owned by L2 `bridge`.

## How does it work?

### Bridging aTokens from L1 to L2

**Approve bridge tokens**

L1 aTokens are approved on the bridge at `initiliaze` where `_approveBridgeTokens` is called internally to approve the provided array of aTokens in an array along with their corresponding static_a_tokens on L2. :warning: Gas limit concerns should apply here!

**Transfer from L1 to L2**

Users can either bridge their `aToken` (let's say aDai) or deposit the
underlying asset (i.e Dai). Users will have to approve the bridge to spend the
underlying `asset` tokens or `aTokens`, depending on the provided value for
`fromUnderlyingAsset` argument when depositing.

Calling `deposit` allows users deposit `aTokens` or their underlying `asset`:

If depositing underlying `asset`:

- The `asset` token will be transferred from the user account to the L1 bridge.
- The bridge will then deposit the `asset` token in the aToken.
- A message will be sent to the L2 bridge with the amount of `static_a_token`
  to be transferred, the L1 token address, the recipient address, the block number and the rewards index.
- The token bridge on L2 will then be minting the corresponding
  `static_a_token` of the L1 token to the user.

If depositing `aTokens`:

- The `aTokens` will be transferred from the user account to the L1 bridge.
- A message will be sent to the L2 bridge with the amount to be transferred,
  the L1 token address and the recipient address as parameters.
- The token bridge on L2 will then be minting the corresponding `static_a_token`
  of the L1 token to the user.

**Transfer L2 to L1**

To bridge their `aTokens` back to L1, users need to initiate a withdrawal on the L2 token bridge.

Calling `initiate_withdraw` will result in the following:

- The amount to withdraw will be burned by the bridge
- A message will be sent to L1 with the L1 token address, the L1 recipient, the
  L2 rewards index and the amount
- The L1 bridge will then transfer the `aTokens` to the L1 recipient
- The L1 bridge also checks for any difference in the L1/L2 rewards index and
  transfers any unclaimed rewards to the L1 user

### Synchronisation of rewards on L1 and L2

Starknet users will continue to enjoy the same rewards as on L1 after bridging
their assets. To achieve that we continuously update the `rewards_index` of all
`static_a_token`s to match the value of their respective `aTokens` on L1, by
tracking the reward index on departure of the `static_a_token` and sending the
rewards accrued during the bridging process to the recipients address.

### Claiming rewards on L2

To claim rewards users need to call `claim_rewards` on static_a_token contract
which calls the bridge in return to mint the due `rewAAVE` tokens to the user.

### Bridging rewards from L2 to L1

Calling `bridge_rewards` on L2 token bridge results in:

- The bridged amount of `rewAAVE` tokens will be burned.
- The L1 bridge receives the bridging message and claims the rewards amount to
  self by calling `claimRewards` on the `IncentivesController` contract.
- The rewards are then transferred to the L1 recipient.

### ATokens deposit cancellation
If L1 -> L2 message consumption is unsuccessful, the user would lose custody over his aTokens forever.

That's why we have added support for the L1->L2 message cancellation on our L1 bridge contract, where users can cancel deposits of their aTokens by following the steps below:

1. The user calls `startDepositCancellation` on L1 bridge by providing the `message payload` and `nonce` of the `deposit` message.

2. After the `messageCancellationDelay` period has passed (defined on [StarknetMessaging](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starkgate-contracts/blob/c08863a1f08226c09f1d0748124192e848d73db9/src/starkware/starknet/solidity/StarknetMessaging.sol) contract), the user can finalize the aTokens deposit cancellation by calling `cancelDeposit` on L1 bridge.

## Installation

### Environment

**Install Node 16**

Our codebase relies on Node 16. To install it, you can first install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and then run the following commands:

```bash
nvm install 16
nvm use
```

**Install Python 3.7.12**

Our codebase relies on Python 3.7.12. To install it, you can first install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and then run the following commands:

```bash
pyenv install 3.7.12
pyenv local 3.7.12
```

**Install GMP (needed for Cairo)**

Before installing Cairo you need to install GMP. Run one of the following command depending on your OS.

```bash
sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev # linux
brew install gmp # mac
```

**Install Node dependencies**

Let's install all our project dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

**Install Python dependencies**

Let’s create a virtual environment to isolate your project’s
requirements from your global Python environment.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install poetry for dependencies management

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install poetry
poetry install
```

### Build Cairo files

Solidity files are automatically compiled before running the tests, but Cairo files are not. To compile them, run:

```bash
yarn compile:l2
```

### Start testnets

We recommend to run L1 and L2 testnets in different terminals.

**Start L2 testnet**

In a terminal where `venv` is activated, run:

```bash
yarn testnet:l2
```

**Start L1 testnet**

Create a `.env` file from the sample (`cp .env.sample .env`), and fill a value for the variable `ALCHEMY KEY` - you can get one [here](https://www.alchemy.com/). Then, load all the environment variables.

```bash
source .env
```

And start L1 testnet in the same terminal by running:

```bash
yarn testnet:l1
```

### Run tests

The project is tested using [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), the [starknet
hardhat plugin](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin) and
[starknet-devnet](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet). We created a Docker Compose file to run tests easily: we start L1 and L2 test networks in two separate containers and run the tests from a third one. To run all tests, simply run the following commands:

```
docker compose up --build
docker exec -ti $(docker ps -f name=test-runner -q) bash
yarn test
```

### Deployment

First make sure to set the aTokens addresses to be approved on the bridge as well as the metadata related to the `staticATokens` to be deployed on l2 in `./scripts/allowlistedTokens.ts`.

```bash
yarn deploy-bridge:testnet #deploys bridge on l1 & l2 testnets
```
